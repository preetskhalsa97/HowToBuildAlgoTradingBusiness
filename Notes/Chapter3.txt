BACKTESTING- evaluating how the strategy would have performed in the past

Common backtesting platforms
1. Excel- avoids look ahead bias, can only be used for simple strategies though
2. MATLAB- sophisticated math built in, can be used to pull financial data from the internet; example on pg.34
3. Tradestation- provides all in one backtesting and trade execution platforms; Once you have backtested the program, you can immediately generate orders using the same program and transmit them to the brokerage.
disadvantages of tradestation- proprietary language; once tested there, can't use any other platform to trade

WHAT IS SPLITING OF STOCKS?
split ==> N to 1; if N<1 ==> reverse split

--> High and low data are far noisier than open and close data; Sometimes, the high or low is simply
due to an incorrectly reported tick that was not filtered out.

Typically, an extreme return should be accompanied by a news announcement, or should occur on a day when the market index also experienced extreme returns. If not, then your data is suspect

--> author argues that sharpe ratio and drawdowns are two most important parameters
pg. 44:
you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs financing cost.

COMMON PITFALLS DURING BACKTESTING

1. Look ahead bias- strategy uses data that is available after the order has been made; eg. “Buy when the
stock is within 1 percent of the day’s low”, using results of regression coefficients of a model of the past

Avoid the bias ==> as many variableas as possible should be LAGGED
WHAT IS MOVIng AVERAGE?!
pg. 52 ==> Read this section properly

2. Data Snooping Bias- Backtest performance is inflated as compared to actual performance. 

==> Break the sample down in two parts, use one to model, other for out of sample testing

==> No. of data  points = 252 * no. of free parameters used to build the model

--> 1 base point = 0.01%

STRATEGY REFINEMENT
If the backtest performance is unsatisfactory, do parameter optimization. 
Whatever changes you do to optimize performance on the training set, should enhance performance on the test set
as well. 

PAIR TRADING OF STOCKS
- market neutral strategy: A market-neutral strategy is a type of investment strategy undertaken by an investor or an investment manager that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets, while attempting to completely avoid some specific form of market risk.
