STATIONARITY AND COINTEGRATION
A time series is “stationary” if it never drifts farther and farther away
from its initial value. In technical terms, stationary time series are
“integrated of order zero,” or I(0). (See Alexander, 2001.) It is obvi-
ous that if the price series of a security is stationary, it would be a
great candidate for a mean-reversion strategy. Unfortunately, most
stock price series are not stationary—they exhibit a geometric ran-
dom walk that gets them farther and farther away from their start-
ing (i.e., initial public offering) values.

==> A stationary series is a great candidate for mean reverting strategy.

Stationary series: Having same characteristics like mean, sd, autocorrelation throughout.

Optimal hedge ratio: nuber of shares of one security/ number of shares of the other security
